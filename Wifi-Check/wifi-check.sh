#
# Purpose:
#
# Script checks to see if WiFi has a network IP and if not
# restart WiFi
#
# Uses a lock file which prevents the script from running more
# than one at a time.  If lockfile is old, it removes it
#
# Instructions:
#
# o Install where you want to run it from like /usr/local/bin
# o chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/WiFi_Check
# o Add to crontab
#
# Run Every 5 mins - Seems like ever min is over kill unless
# this is a very common problem.  If once a min change */5 to *
# once every 2 mins */5 to */2 ...
#
# */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/WiFi_Check
